# The Last Knight Standing
This Python program generates a custom chessboard of user-specified dimensions, places a user-defined number of obstacles on the board, and then finds the shortest path for a knight piece to travel from a given source coordinate to a destination coordinate.


## Introduction
This program is designed as a part of a Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) project. It demonstrates the concept of Backtracking, Djikstra's Algorithm and graph traversal (BFS) to find the shortest path for a knight on a chessboard from a given starting point to a destination, while considering obstacles.


## Features
- Generates a custom chessboard of given dimensions.
- Allows users to place a specified number of obstacles on the chessboard.
- Finds the shortest path for a knight piece from a source to a destination.
- Displays the path as list and the number of moves required to reach the destination.
- Visualizes the path on a 3D chessboard for better understanding.

## Inputs
- Chessboard Dimensions: Enter the dimensions (a single digit) of the chessboard.
- Number of Obstacles: Specify the number of obstacles you want to randomly place on the chessboard.
- Source and Destination Coordinates: Provide the source and destination coordinates for the knight's pathfinding in this format e.g 1,1,3,3 [Where (1,1) is src and (3,3) is dst].


## Improvements
The program currently has some stability and corner cases handling issues and could benefit from further optimization. I would further work on the aesthetics and functionality of this program in the future and just uploading this source code on github for my own refrence. Contributions to improve the look, stability and efficiency of the algorithm are highly appreciated.
